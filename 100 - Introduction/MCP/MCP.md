What is a Model context protocol?


A **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized way for AI models to communicate, share context, and interoperate within a system. MCPs help ensure that different models and components can work together efficiently by defining how information is structured, exchanged, and understood.

## Why are MCPs Important?

- **Interoperability:** Allow different AI models and services to work together seamlessly.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that context and data are shared in a predictable way.
- **Scalability:** Make it easier to add or swap models in a system without major rework.

## Key Concepts

- **Context:** The information (such as user input, previous responses, or environment data) that a model needs to perform its task.
- **Protocol:** The rules and structure for how context is packaged, sent, and received.
